# busch_pdf

This is based on the Quarto extension by Nicola Rennie

Read more about this extension, how it was built, and how to make your own in her blog post at [nrennie.rbind.io/blog/making-pretty-pdf-quarto](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/making-pretty-pdf-quarto/).

## Installation and use

To install the Quarto extension, create a directory, and use the template file:

``` bash
quarto use template richysix/busch_pdf
```

To use the extension in an existing project without installing the template file:

``` bash
quarto install extension richysix/busch_pdf
```

Note that you will need to update the output format in your quarto document to `format: busch_pdf` to enable use of the extension.
